     * A collection can be placed under baseline control with a

     * This version-controlled configuration can be checked out and then
     * checked in to create a new baseline for that collection.
     *
     * If a baseline is specified in the request body, the DAV:checked-in
     * version of the new version-controlled configuration will be that
     * baseline, and the collection is initialized to contain version-
     * controlled members whose DAV:checked-in versions and relative names
     * are determined by the specified baseline.

     * containing a baseline that captures the state of the version-
     * controlled members of the collection, and the DAV:checked-in version
     * of the version-controlled configuration will be that baseline.

     * when the baseline was created.  Any nested collections that are

     * member will be created.
     *
     * (DAV:create-new-baseline): If no baseline is specified in the
     * request body, the request MUST have created a new baseline history

     * The MERGE method performs the logical merge of a specified version

     * (the "merge target").  If the merge source is neither an ancestor nor
     * a descendant of the DAV:checked-in or DAV:checked-out version of the
     * merge target, the MERGE checks out the merge target (if it is not

     * indicates that it has completed the update of the merge target, by
     * deleting the merge source URL from the DAV:merge-set of the checked-
     * out merge target, and adding it to the DAV:predecessor-set.  As an
     * error check for a client forgetting to complete a merge, the server
     * MUST fail an attempt to CHECKIN a version-controlled resource with a
     * non-empty DAV:merge-set.
     *
     * When a server has the ability to automatically update the content and

     * the merge source, it may do so unless DAV:no-auto-merge is specified

     * add the URL of the auto-merged source to the DAV:auto-merge-set
     * property of the merge target, and not to the DAV:merge-set property.

     * and adding it to the DAV:predecessor-set.
     *
     * Multiple merge sources can be specified in a single MERGE request.
     * The set of merge sources for a MERGE request is determined from the

     *
     * -  If DAV:source identifies a collection, the DAV:checked-in version
     *    of each version-controlled resource that is a member of that
     *    collection is a merge source.
     *
     * The request-URL identifies the set of possible merge targets.  If the
     * request-URL identifies a collection, any member of the configuration
     * rooted at the request-URL is a possible merge target.  The merge
     * target of a particular merge source is the version-controlled or
