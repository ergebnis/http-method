     * The MKREDIRECTREF method requests the creation of a redirect

     * If a MKREDIRECTREF request fails, the server state preceding the
     * request MUST be restored.
     *
     * Responses from a MKREDIRECTREF request MUST NOT be cached, as
     * MKREDIRECTREF has non-idempotent and non-safe semantics (see
     * [RFC2616], Section 9.1).

     * <!ELEMENT temporary EMPTY>
     *
     * The DAV:href element is defined in [RFC2518] (Section 12.3) and
     * MUST contain either a URI or a relative-ref (see [RFC3986],
     * Sections 3 and 4.2).
     *
     * If no DAV:redirect-lifetime element is specified, the server MUST
     * behave as if a value of DAV:temporary was specified.
     *
     * If the request succeeds, the server MUST return 201 (Created)
     * status.
     *
     * If a response body for a successful request is included, it MUST
     * be a DAV:mkredirectref-response XML element.  Note that this
     * document does not define any elements for the MKREDIRECTREF
     * response body, but the DAV:mkredirectref-response element is
     * defined to ensure interoperability between future extensions that
     * do define elements for the response body.

     * available for use as a resource name.
     *
     * (DAV:locked-update-allowed): If the collection identified by the
     * Request-URI minus the last path segment is write-locked, then the
     * appropriate token MUST be specified in an If request header.
     *
     * (DAV:redirect-lifetime-supported): If the request body contains a
     * DAV:redirect-lifetime element, the server MUST support the
     * specified lifetime.  Support for DAV:temporary is REQUIRED, while
     * support for DAV:permanent is OPTIONAL.
     *
     * (DAV:legal-reftarget): The specified is a legal URI or relative-
     * ref.
