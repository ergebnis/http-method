     * The BIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-
     * URI, by adding a new binding from the segment specified in the BIND
     * body to the resource identified in the BIND body.
     *
     * If a server cannot guarantee the integrity of the binding, the BIND
     * request MUST fail.  Note that it is especially difficult to maintain
     * the integrity of cross-server bindings.  Unless the server where the
     * resource resides knows about all bindings on all servers to that
     * resource, it may unwittingly destroy the resource or make it
     * inaccessible without notifying another server that manages a binding
     * to the resource.  For example, if server A permits the creation of a
     * binding to a resource on server B, server A must notify server B
     * about its binding and must have an agreement with B that B will not
     * destroy the resource while A's binding exists.  Otherwise, server B
     * may receive a DELETE request that it thinks removes the last binding
     * to the resource and destroy the resource while A's binding still
     * exists.  The precondition DAV:cross-server-binding is defined below
     * for cases where servers fail cross-server BIND requests because they
     * cannot guarantee the integrity of cross-server bindings.
     *
     * By default, if there already is a binding for the specified segment
     * in the collection, the new binding replaces the existing binding.
     * This default binding replacement behavior can be overridden using the
     * Overwrite header defined in Section 10.6 of [RFC4918].
     *
     * If a BIND request fails, the server state preceding the request MUST
     * be restored.  This method is unsafe and idempotent (see [RFC2616],
     * Section 9.1).
     *
     * Marshalling:
     *
     * The request MAY include an Overwrite header.
     *
     * The request body MUST be a DAV:bind XML element.
     *
     * <!ELEMENT bind (segment, href)>
     *
     * If the request succeeds, the server MUST return 201 (Created) when
     * a new binding was created and 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) when an
     * existing binding was replaced.
     *
     * If a response body for a successful request is included, it MUST
     * be a DAV:bind-response XML element.  Note that this document does
     * not define any elements for the BIND response body, but the DAV:
     * bind-response element is defined to ensure interoperability
     * between future extensions that do define elements for the BIND
     * response body.
     *
     * <!ELEMENT bind-response ANY>
     *
     * Preconditions:
     *
     * (DAV:bind-into-collection): The Request-URI MUST identify a
     * collection.
     *
     * (DAV:bind-source-exists): The DAV:href element MUST identify a
     * resource.
     *
     * (DAV:binding-allowed): The resource identified by the DAV:href
     * supports multiple bindings to it.
     *
     * (DAV:cross-server-binding): If the resource identified by the DAV:
     * href element in the request body is on another server from the
     * collection identified by the Request-URI, the server MUST support
     * cross-server bindings (servers that do not support cross-server
     * bindings can use this condition code to signal the client exactly
     * why the request failed).
     *
     * (DAV:name-allowed): The name specified by the DAV:segment is
     * available for use as a new binding name.
     *
     * (DAV:can-overwrite): If the collection already contains a binding
     * with the specified path segment, and if an Overwrite header is
     * included, the value of the Overwrite header MUST be "T".
     *
     * (DAV:cycle-allowed): If the DAV:href element identifies a
     * collection, and if the Request-URI identifies a collection that is
     * a member of that collection, the server MUST support cycles in the
     * URI namespace (servers that do not support cycles can use this
     * condition code to signal the client exactly why the request
     * failed).
     *
     * (DAV:locked-update-allowed): If the collection identified by the
     * Request-URI is write-locked, then the appropriate token MUST be
     * specified in an If request header.
     *
     * (DAV:locked-overwrite-allowed): If the collection already contains
     * a binding with the specified path segment, and if that binding is
     * protected by a write lock, then the appropriate token MUST be
     * specified in an If request header.
     *
     * Postconditions:
     *
     * (DAV:new-binding): The collection MUST have a binding that maps
