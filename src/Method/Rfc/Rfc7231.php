     * The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
     * the destination origin server identified by the request-target and,
     * if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding
     * of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.  Tunnels
     * are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through
     * one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport
     * Layer Security, [RFC5246]).
     *
     * CONNECT is intended only for use in requests to a proxy.  An origin
     * server that receives a CONNECT request for itself MAY respond with a
     * 2xx (Successful) status code to indicate that a connection is
     * established.  However, most origin servers do not implement CONNECT.
     *
     * A client sending a CONNECT request MUST send the authority form of
     * request-target (Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]); i.e., the request-target
     * consists of only the host name and port number of the tunnel
     * destination, separated by a colon.  For example,
     *
     * CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
     * Host: server.example.com:80
     *
     * The recipient proxy can establish a tunnel either by directly
     * connecting to the request-target or, if configured to use another
     * proxy, by forwarding the CONNECT request to the next inbound proxy.
     * Any 2xx (Successful) response indicates that the sender (and all
     * inbound proxies) will switch to tunnel mode immediately after the
     * blank line that concludes the successful response's header section;
     * data received after that blank line is from the server identified by
     * the request-target.  Any response other than a successful response
     * indicates that the tunnel has not yet been formed and that the
     * connection remains governed by HTTP.
     *
     * A tunnel is closed when a tunnel intermediary detects that either
     * side has closed its connection: the intermediary MUST attempt to send
     * any outstanding data that came from the closed side to the other
     * side, close both connections, and then discard any remaining data
     * left undelivered.
     *
     * Proxy authentication might be used to establish the authority to
     * create a tunnel.  For example,
     *
     * CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
     * Host: server.example.com:80
     * Proxy-Authorization: basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=
     *
     * There are significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary
     * servers, particularly when the destination is a well-known or
     * reserved TCP port that is not intended for Web traffic.  For example,
     * a CONNECT to a request-target of "example.com:25" would suggest that
     * the proxy connect to the reserved port for SMTP traffic; if allowed,
     * that could trick the proxy into relaying spam email.  Proxies that
     * support CONNECT SHOULD restrict its use to a limited set of known
     * ports or a configurable whitelist of safe request targets.
     *
     * A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
     * fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT.  A client MUST
     * ignore any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields received
     * in a successful response to CONNECT.
     *
     * A payload within a CONNECT request message has no defined semantics;
     * sending a payload body on a CONNECT request might cause some existing
     * implementations to reject the request.
     *
     * Responses to the CONNECT method are not cacheable.

     * The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the
     * association between the target resource and its current
     * functionality.  In effect, this method is similar to the rm command
     * in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the
     * origin server rather than an expectation that the previously
     * associated information be deleted.
     *
     * If the target resource has one or more current representations, they
     * might or might not be destroyed by the origin server, and the
     * associated storage might or might not be reclaimed, depending
     * entirely on the nature of the resource and its implementation by the
     * origin server (which are beyond the scope of this specification).
     * Likewise, other implementation aspects of a resource might need to be
     * deactivated or archived as a result of a DELETE, such as database or
     * gateway connections.  In general, it is assumed that the origin
     * server will only allow DELETE on resources for which it has a
     * prescribed mechanism for accomplishing the deletion.
     *
     * Relatively few resources allow the DELETE method -- its primary use
     * is for remote authoring environments, where the user has some
     * direction regarding its effect.  For example, a resource that was
     * previously created using a PUT request, or identified via the
     * Location header field after a 201 (Created) response to a POST
     * request, might allow a corresponding DELETE request to undo those
     * actions.  Similarly, custom user agent implementations that implement
     * an authoring function, such as revision control clients using HTTP
     * for remote operations, might use DELETE based on an assumption that
     * the server's URI space has been crafted to correspond to a version
     * repository.
     *
     * If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD
     * send a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed
     * but has not yet been enacted, a 204 (No Content) status code if the
     * action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied,
     * or a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the
     * response message includes a representation describing the status.

     * A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics;
     * sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing
     * implementations to reject the request.
     *
     * Responses to the DELETE method are not cacheable.  If a DELETE
     * request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses
     * for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be
     * invalidated (see Section 4.4 of [RFC7234]).

     * retrieval and the focus of almost all performance optimizations.
     * Hence, when people speak of retrieving some identifiable information
     * via HTTP, they are generally referring to making a GET request.
     *
     * It is tempting to think of resource identifiers as remote file system
     * pathnames and of representations as being a copy of the contents of
     * such files.  In fact, that is how many resources are implemented (see
     * Section 9.1 for related security considerations).  However, there are
     * no such limitations in practice.  The HTTP interface for a resource
     * is just as likely to be implemented as a tree of content objects, a
     * programmatic view on various database records, or a gateway to other
     * information systems.  Even when the URI mapping mechanism is tied to
     * a file system, an origin server might be configured to execute the
     * files with the request as input and send the output as the
     * representation rather than transfer the files directly.  Regardless,
     * only the origin server needs to know how each of its resource
     * identifiers corresponds to an implementation and how each
     * implementation manages to select and send a current representation of
     * the target resource in a response to GET.
     *
     * A client can alter the semantics of GET to be a "range request",

     * An OPTIONS request with an asterisk ("*") as the request-target
     * (Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]) applies to the server in general rather
     * than to a specific resource.  Since a server's communication options
     * typically depend on the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a
     * "ping" or "no-op" type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the
     * client to test the capabilities of the server.  For example, this can
     * be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 conformance (or lack thereof).
     *
     * If the request-target is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
     * to the options that are available when communicating with the target
     * resource.

     * server MUST generate a Content-Length field with a value of "0" if no
     * payload body is to be sent in the response.

     * A client MAY send a Max-Forwards header field in an OPTIONS request

     * The POST method requests that the target resource process the

     * own specific semantics.
     *
     * For example, POST is used for the following functions (among others):
     *
     * - Providing a block of data, such as the fields entered into an HTML
     *   form, to a data-handling process;
     *
     * - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,

     * - Creating a new resource that has yet to be identified by the
     *   origin server; and
     *
     * - Appending data to a resource's existing representation(s).
     *
     * An origin server indicates response semantics by choosing an
     * appropriate status code depending on the result of processing the
     * POST request; almost all of the status codes defined by this
     * specification might be received in a response to POST (the exceptions
     * being 206 (Partial Content), 304 (Not Modified), and 416 (Range Not
     * Satisfiable)).
     *
     * If one or more resources has been created on the origin server as a
     * result of successfully processing a POST request, the origin server
     * SHOULD send a 201 (Created) response containing a Location header
     * field that provides an identifier for the primary resource created
     * (Section 7.1.2) and a representation that describes the status of the
     * request while referring to the new resource(s).
     *
     * Responses to POST requests are only cacheable when they include
     * explicit freshness information (see Section 4.2.1 of [RFC7234]).
     * However, POST caching is not widely implemented.  For cases where an
     * origin server wishes the client to be able to cache the result of a

     * MAY send a 200 (OK) response containing the result and a
     * Content-Location header field that has the same value as the POST's
     * effective request URI (Section 3.1.4.2).
     *
     * If the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a
     * representation of an existing resource, an origin server MAY redirect
     * the user agent to that resource by sending a 303 (See Other) response
     * with the existing resource's identifier in the Location field.  This
     * has the benefits of providing the user agent a resource identifier

     * The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be
     * created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
     * enclosed in the request message payload.  A successful PUT of a given
     * representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same
     * target resource will result in an equivalent representation being
     * sent in a 200 (OK) response.  However, there is no guarantee that
     * such a state change will be observable, since the target resource
     * might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be
     * subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any
     * subsequent GET is received.  A successful response only implies that
     * the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by
     * the origin server.
     *
     * If the target resource does not have a current representation and the
     * PUT successfully creates one, then the origin server MUST inform the
     * user agent by sending a 201 (Created) response.  If the target
     * resource does have a current representation and that representation
     * is successfully modified in accordance with the state of the enclosed
     * representation, then the origin server MUST send either a 200 (OK) or
     * a 204 (No Content) response to indicate successful completion of the
     * request.
     *
     * An origin server SHOULD ignore unrecognized header fields received in
     * a PUT request (i.e., do not save them as part of the resource state).
     *
     * An origin server SHOULD verify that the PUT representation is
     * consistent with any constraints the server has for the target
     * resource that cannot or will not be changed by the PUT.  This is
     * particularly important when the origin server uses internal
     * configuration information related to the URI in order to set the
     * values for representation metadata on GET responses.  When a PUT
     * representation is inconsistent with the target resource, the origin
     * server SHOULD either make them consistent, by transforming the
     * representation or changing the resource configuration, or respond
     * with an appropriate error message containing sufficient information
     * to explain why the representation is unsuitable.  The 409 (Conflict)
     * or 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status codes are suggested, with the
     * latter being specific to constraints on Content-Type values.
     *
     * For example, if the target resource is configured to always have a
     * Content-Type of "text/html" and the representation being PUT has a
     * Content-Type of "image/jpeg", the origin server ought to do one of:
     *
     * a. reconfigure the target resource to reflect the new media type;
     *
     * b. transform the PUT representation to a format consistent with that
     *    of the resource before saving it as the new resource state; or,
     *
     * c. reject the request with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response
     *    indicating that the target resource is limited to "text/html",
     *    perhaps including a link to a different resource that would be a
     *    suitable target for the new representation.
     *
     * HTTP does not define exactly how a PUT method affects the state of an
     * origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent of the user
     * agent request and the semantics of the origin server response.  It
     * does not define what a resource might be, in any sense of that word,
     * beyond the interface provided via HTTP.  It does not define how
     * resource state is "stored", nor how such storage might change as a
     * result of a change in resource state, nor how the origin server
     * translates resource state into representations.  Generally speaking,
     * all implementation details behind the resource interface are
     * intentionally hidden by the server.
     *
     * An origin server MUST NOT send a validator header field
     * (Section 7.2), such as an ETag or Last-Modified field, in a
     * successful response to PUT unless the request's representation data
     * was saved without any transformation applied to the body (i.e., the
     * resource's new representation data is identical to the representation
     * data received in the PUT request) and the validator field value
     * reflects the new representation.  This requirement allows a user
     * agent to know when the representation body it has in memory remains
     * current as a result of the PUT, thus not in need of being retrieved
     * again from the origin server, and that the new validator(s) received
     * in the response can be used for future conditional requests in order
     * to prevent accidental overwrites (Section 5.2).
     *
     * The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT methods is
     * highlighted by the different intent for the enclosed representation.
     * The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the
     * enclosed representation according to the resource's own semantics,
     * whereas the enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as
     * replacing the state of the target resource.  Hence, the intent of PUT
     * is idempotent and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact
     * effect is only known by the origin server.
     *
     * Proper interpretation of a PUT request presumes that the user agent
     * knows which target resource is desired.  A service that selects a
     * proper URI on behalf of the client, after receiving a state-changing
     * request, SHOULD be implemented using the POST method rather than PUT.
     * If the origin server will not make the requested PUT state change to
     * the target resource and instead wishes to have it applied to a
     * different resource, such as when the resource has been moved to a
     * different URI, then the origin server MUST send an appropriate 3xx
     * (Redirection) response; the user agent MAY then make its own decision
     * regarding whether or not to redirect the request.
     *
     * A PUT request applied to the target resource can have side effects on
     * other resources.  For example, an article might have a URI for
     * identifying "the current version" (a resource) that is separate from
     * the URIs identifying each particular version (different resources
     * that at one point shared the same state as the current version
     * resource).  A successful PUT request on "the current version" URI
     * might therefore create a new version resource in addition to changing
     * the state of the target resource, and might also cause links to be
     * added between the related resources.
     *
     * An origin server that allows PUT on a given target resource MUST send
     * a 400 (Bad Request) response to a PUT request that contains a
     * Content-Range header field (Section 4.2 of [RFC7233]), since the
     * payload is likely to be partial content that has been mistakenly PUT
     * as a full representation.  Partial content updates are possible by
     * targeting a separately identified resource with state that overlaps a
     * portion of the larger resource, or by using a different method that
     * has been specifically defined for partial updates (for example, the
     * PATCH method defined in [RFC5789]).
     *
     * Responses to the PUT method are not cacheable.  If a successful PUT
     * request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses
     * for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be
     * invalidated (see Section 4.4 of [RFC7234]).
